# 🍓 pihole-ansible

This collection provides Ansible modules and roles for managing PiHole v6 via a custom API client. This collection is built on top of the [pihole6api](https://github.com/sbarbett/pihole6api) Python library, which handles authentication and requests.

## Overview

This collection includes:

- **Modules:**
  - `local_a_record`: Manage local A records.
  - `local_aaaa_record`: Manage local AAAAA records. (see `local_a_record` configuration and examples )
  - `local_cname`: Manage local CNAME records.
  - `dhcp_config`: Enable, disable and configure the DHCP client.
  - `dhcp_remove_lease`: Delete existing leases.
  - `listening_mode`: Toggle the PiHole's listening mode.
  - `block_list`: Manage block lists.
  - `allow_list`: Manage allow lists.
  - `groups`: Manage groups.
  - `clients`: Manage clients.

- **Roles:**
  - `manage_local_records`: A role that iterates over one or more PiHole hosts and manages a batch of local DNS records (both A and CNAME) as defined by the user. ([README](https://github.com/sbarbett/pihole-ansible/blob/main/roles/manage_local_records/README.md))
  - `manage_lists`: A role that iterates over one or more PiHole hosts and manages a batch of allow and block lists as defined by the user. ([README](https://github.com/sbarbett/pihole-ansible/blob/main/roles/manage_lists/README.md))
  - `manage_groups_clients`: A role that iterates over one or more PiHole hosts and manages a batch of groups and clients as defined by the user. ([README](https://github.com/sbarbett/pihole-ansible/blob/main/roles/manage_groups_clients/README.md))

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Ansible:** Version 2.9 or later.
- **Python:** The control node requires Python 3.x.
- **pihole6api Library**

### Installation

Install the collection via Ansible Galaxy:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install sbarbett.pihole
```

You can also build it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbarbett/pihole-ansible
ansible-galaxy collection build
ansible-galaxy collection install sbarbett-pihole-x.x.x.tar.gz
```

#### `pihole6api` Dependency

The `pihole6api` library is required for this Ansible collection to function. The installation method depends on how you installed Ansible.

```bash
pip install pihole6api
```

However, some Linux distributions (Debian, macOS, Fedora, etc.) **restrict system-wide `pip` installs** due to [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/). In that case, use one of the methods below.

**Installing in a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

If you want an isolated environment that won’t interfere with system-wide packages, install both `pihole6api` and Ansible in a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pihole6api ansible
```

To confirm that `ansible` and `pihole6api` are installed correctly within the environment, run:

```bash
which python && which ansible
python -c "import pihole6api; print(pihole6api.__file__)"
```

To exit the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

**Using `pipx`:**

If Ansible is installed via `pipx`, inject `pihole6api` into Ansible’s environment:

```bash
pipx inject ansible pihole6api --include-deps
```

Verify installation:

```bash
pipx runpip ansible show pihole6api
```

Since Ansible does not automatically detect `pipx` environments, you must explicitly set the Python interpreter in your Ansible configuration:

Edit `ansible.cfg`:

```
[defaults]
interpreter_python = ~/.local/pipx/venvs/ansible/bin/python
```

For more information on `pipx` see [the official documentation](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) and [the Ansible install guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

**Installing for System-Wide Ansible (Generally Not Recommended):**

If Ansible was installed via a package manager (`apt`, `dnf`, `brew`) and a virtual environment or `pipx` is not a feasible or desired solution, run `pip` with `--break-system-packages` to bypass **PEP 668** restrictions:

```bash
sudo pip install --break-system-packages pihole6api
```

Verify installation:

```bash
python3 -c "import pihole6api; print(pihole6api.__file__)"

```
