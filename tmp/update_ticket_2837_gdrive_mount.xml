    <param><string>The `google_drive_mount` Ansible role and `mount_google_drive.yml` playbook have been created to automate the mounting of a user's Google Drive to `~/gDrive`.

=== Role: `google_drive_mount` ===
This role performs the following actions:
*   Installs the `rclone` package.
*   Creates the `~/gDrive` mount point.
*   Deploys a pre-configured `rclone.conf` file to `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`.
*   Deploys a systemd user service file to `~/.config/systemd/user/gdrive-rclone.service` to make the mount persistent.
*   Enables and starts the systemd user service.

=== Playbook: `mount_google_drive.yml` ===
This playbook applies the `google_drive_mount` role to the `[desktops]` group, targeting the `will` user.

=== Usage ===
To apply the Google Drive mount to a desktop, ensure the host is in the `[desktops]` group in the `inventory.ini` file, and then run:
`ansible-playbook playbooks/mount_google_drive.yml -i inventory.ini --limit <target_host>`

The playbook has been successfully tested on `venus`.</string></param>
