# n8n-agenda-matic

This project contains an n8n workflow for creating agendas.

## Current Status

The workflow has been created and is located in `workflow.json`.

### Next Steps

1.  Import the `workflow.json` file into your n8n instance.
2.  Update the Google Drive node with your credentials.
3.  Manually trigger the workflow to test the execution.

### Known Issues

I am currently unable to update the Trac ticket (#2829) due to a persistent "Bad Request" error from the Trac API. The ticket should be updated with the information in this README.
