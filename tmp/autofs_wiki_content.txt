== Playbook: `configure_autofs_client.yml` ==

=== Purpose ===
This Ansible playbook configures a client machine to use `autofs` for automatically mounting network file shares. It is designed to ensure that specified mounts are available on demand, improving system resource utilization and simplifying share management.

=== Usage ===
To run this playbook, ensure the target host is defined in your Ansible `inventory.ini` and accessible via SSH. You can execute it using the following command:

<code>
ansible-playbook playbooks/configure_autofs_client.yml -i inventory.ini --limit &lt;target_host&gt;
</code>

=== Variables ===
This playbook may utilize variables defined in `group_vars/all.yml` or `host_vars/<target_host>.yml` for configuring specific mount points, server addresses, and other `autofs` related settings.

=== Configuration Details ===
*   Installs the `autofs` package.
*   Configures the main `autofs` configuration files (e.g., `/etc/auto.master`).
*   Sets up specific mount maps (e.g., `/etc/auto.misc` or custom maps) for network shares.
*   Ensures the `autofs` service is running and enabled.
