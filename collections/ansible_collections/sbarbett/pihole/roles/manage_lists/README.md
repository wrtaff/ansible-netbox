# manage_lists

This role is designed to manage allow lists and block lists on one or more Pi-hole instances. It iterates over a list of Pi-hole hosts and applies list changes as defined by the user.

## Overview

- Manage allow lists and block lists on multiple Pi-hole instances using batch processing.
- Ensure idempotent operations: lists are added, updated, or removed based on the desired state.
- Support for group names instead of just group IDs, with automatic mapping to the correct IDs.
- Efficient processing by grouping operations by list type.

## Requirements

- **Ansible:** 2.9 or later.
- **Python:** The control node must have the `piholev6api` library installed.
- **Pi-hole API Access:** Each Pi-hole instance must be accessible with a valid URL and API password.

## Role Variables

### `pihole_hosts`

A list of dictionaries representing the Pi-hole instances you want to manage. Each dictionary should include:

- `name`: The URL of the Pi-hole instance (e.g., `https://pi.hole`).
- `password`: The API password for the instance.

### `pihole_lists`

A list of list definitions. Each list is a dictionary with the following keys:

* `address`: The URL of the list.
* `type`: The list type. Allowed values are `allow` or `block`.
* `comment`: (Optional) A comment describing the list.
* `groups`: (Optional) A list of group names or IDs to associate with the list. 
  * If using group names, the role will map these to their corresponding IDs.
  * If using group IDs, they must be integers.
* `enabled`: (Optional) Whether the list is enabled. Default is `true`.
* `state`: Desired state for the list. Allowed values are `present` or `absent`.
